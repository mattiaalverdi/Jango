Introduce me Into GHub
Hello World 

I am an engineering student specializing in automation, particularly interested in system and process control. To date, I have practical experience with PLCs, but I would like to further my knowledge by analyzing more complex processes such as electric drives or motion control. I have experience in 3D and 2D modeling in mechanical design or electrical schematic design.

In my free time, I practice martial arts and have a green thumb.
